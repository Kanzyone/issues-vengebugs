# issues-vengebugs

This project is based on a fork of the original <code><a href="https://github.com/Kanzyone/Venge-Bugs">venge-bugs</a></code> repository. Since GitHub does not allow creating new Issues directly on a fork in this setup, a separate repository called `issues-vengebugs` was created to manage bug reports and tracking.

All Issues are opened in the `issues-vengebugs` repository and then manually linked to the main <code><a href="https://github.com/Kanzyone/Venge-Bugs">venge-bugs</a></code> Project Board. This allows us to keep a centralized planning and tracking system while still working with the forked codebase.

This structure ensures:

- Organized bug reporting
- Active issue tracking
- Proper integration with the main project board
